# role-bot-jubilant
This bot has come into existance since Discord won't implement
<https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/1500000431702-Feature-Request-More-granular-support-for-pinging-roles>
and I can't fudge [Carl.gg](https://carl.gg/)'s Tagscript to do what I want.

## Goals
 - Implement a form of ACL for pinging reaction roles
 - Either:
    a) Have the bot edit messages from privilidged users to have the ping
    b) Add a command (&ping \[?]) for manual invocation
